// moment.js language configuration
// language : default (US english)
//
// Since en-US is the default language used by the moment library, we
// don't need to have any content here.  This file is just a
// placeholder indicating the user wants US English.
//
// We need this file because inject_i18n_strings causes
// __language__.js to point to en.js for unsupported languages (such
// as 'boxes'), so en.js must always exist in this directory.
//
// Maybe the right fix is to change inject_i18n_strings.py to point
// somewhere else if en.js doesn't exist, but this fix is easier.
